== Preamble

You should be somewhat familiar with the https://quarkus.io[Quarkus framework] before creating your Quarkus Discord Bot. Quarkus has extensive documentation at {quarkus-guides} to help you get started.

Additionally, the https://docs.discord4j.com[Discord4J documentation] and the https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#commands-and-events-gateway-events[Discord API Gateway event documentation] are essential resources to have on hand.

TIP: Discord4J uses https://projectreactor.io[Project Reactor] as its reactive framework instead of Mutiny, the reactive layer most Quarkus users will be familiar with. For this reason, reactive listener methods support returning `Mono` instead of `Uni` and `Flux` instead of `Multi`, but you can still https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/latest/guides/converters/#integration-with-project-reactor[convert your Reactor streams into Mutiny streams] if you want.

The https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator[Choosing an Operator guide] might be useful to you if you don't want to convert your streams.

== Events

=== Listening to events

To listen to Gateway events, simply declare a method with an event type parameter and annotate it with `@GatewayEvent`. The method can return `Mono`, `Uni`, `Flux`, or `Multi`.

Here's an example of an imperative listener method:

[source,java]
----
class AddReaction {
    Mono<Void> onMessageCreate(@GatewayEvent MessageCreateEvent event) {
        return event.getMessage().addReaction(ReactionEmoji.of("ðŸ¤–"));
    }
}
----

A few details about Gateway listener methods:

* The declaring class and method can be public, protected, or package private
* The declaring class has to be a concrete class
* The method should be concrete
* The annotated event must be the first parameter

=== Event types

All the currently supported event types can be found by checking out the subclasses of the link:{discord4j-javadoc-url}/event/domain/Event.html[Event class].

== Bean injection

=== Gateway client

You can inject a link:{discord4j-javadoc-url}/GatewayDiscordClient.html[`GatewayDiscordClient`] bean that exposes high level methods to manage Discord resources via REST, access the underlying entity cache, and manage your bot's connection to the Gateway and Voice Gateway.

NOTE: This usually isn't necessary as each Discord4J event exposes the Gateway client via `Event#getClient()`, and you can manage most resources directly from its corresponding entity instance.

An example:
[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
class MyBean {
    @Inject
    GatewayDiscordClient gateway;

    // do something with gateway
}
----

=== Into methods

Any method that listens to a Gateway event can inject beans as additional parameters.

For example:
[source,java]
----
class DeletePersistentMessage {
    Mono<Void> onMessageDelete(@GatewayEvent MessageDeleteEvent event, EntityManager em) {
        // do something with em
    }
}
----

== Metrics

If your Quarkus app uses a metrics extension like link:{quarkus-guides}/micrometer[Micrometer] or link:{quarkus-guides}/smallrye-metrics[SmallRye Metrics], you can enable metrics collection for your bot exposed at the `/q/metrics` endpoint by setting the configuration property `quarkus.discord-bot.metrics.enabled` to true.

Currently, metrics are collected for the number of servers your bot is in and the number of voice channels your bot is in.

== Health check

A readiness health check for your bot is automatically exposed at the `/q/health/ready` endpoint if your Quarkus app depends on link:{quarkus-guides}/smallrye-health[SmallRye Health]. All of your bot's shards will be checked and the health status will be `DOWN` if any shard isn't connected.

You can disable the health check by setting `quarkus.discord-bot.health.enabled` to false.

== Native executable

You can package your Discord Bot into a native executable with GraalVM or Mandrel to reduce its memory footprint and speed up its boot time. See the https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image[Building a native executable guide] for more information.

== Configuration

You can configure the following properties:
